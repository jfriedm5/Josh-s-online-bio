  <h2>About Josh!</h2>
  <div>
    <p>I lived in New York for 30 years before moving to Charlotte April of '22. I worked in the electrical industry for various supply houses and contractors. Most recently I was a purchasing agent helping to keep important jobsites working, making sure they get the product they needed at the right time and at the right price.</p>
    <p>I was let go from my position after working full time remote in Charlotte for 14 months due to downsizing. Now I am a <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a> student learning to <strong>code</strong> and studying to be a <strong>software developer</strong> .</p>
    <p>If you're looking to hire a new developer please reach out! I am very excited to learn, grow, and connect with other developers while expanding my newfound passion for <strong>coding</strong>! I am always looking for new people and opportunities to grow and learn.</p>
